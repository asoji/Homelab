## Preamble
So, unfortunately, what you are witnessing, is basically how I run my Homelab at home. Majority of this is hosted on a
mediocre gaming laptop from 2020, that personally I'd like to call `Peridot v3`, aka, `pv3`. Reason why it's called that
is because I named my first Homelab on a tower I called `Peridot`, and then on another machine that isn't mine, formerly
`Peridot v2`, and then this current attempt on even more different hardware, which I call `Peridot v3`/`pv3`.

The specs of Peridot v3 is the following:

```
OS: Fedora 42 Server Edition [at the time of writing]
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3750H 4c/8t
RAM: 16GB DDR4-2400 [8GB Soldered + 8GB SODIMM]
GPU: AMD RX Vega 10 iGPU + NVIDIA GTX 1660ti Max-Q dGPU
STORAGE: 1 x 500GB WD_BLACK SN750 [boot/everything] + 1 x 1TB WD_BLACK SN770 [media]
```

So yeah, if I can run a nice-ish Homelab on a gaming laptop with a shit CPU from 2020, you can probably run this on your
devices as well.
