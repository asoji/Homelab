# Homelab
most, if not, all of my docker compose stuff for my homelab. will not contain instructions for the most part. this will be gradually open sourced as i try to move things, since it's all very messy on my prod system

`/docs` is not part of the homelab, more just documentation for myself and whoever else looks at it. please use `pnpm` to build, no `yarn` or `npm` or **i will steal your fuckin knees. i am not kidding.**
